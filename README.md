# Proteome-scale prediction of phosphorytaion events that disrupt protein-protein interactions
Systematically mapped thousands of phosphorylation events from budding yeast proteome on to 3D structures and identified modifications that could negatively regulate protein-protein interactions.

**Summary**
This study compiles a large set of independent experiments into a comprehensive phosphoproteome resource for the budding yeast community. 3D analysis of protein interaction interfaces and other strategies are used to predict functionality amongst the ≥ 40,000 reported phosphorylation events.

* 75 independent phosphoproteomic experiments were consolidated into a comprehensive resource of over 40,000 budding yeast phosphorylation sites.

* Multiple strategies were used to infer functional phosphorylation events.

* Mapping phosphorylation sites to protein interaction interfaces revealed phosphorylation sites that regulate protein-protein interactions.

The information has been compiled into the SuperPhos online database (superphos.yulab.org), which lists all identified phosphorylation sites in budding yeast and displays their proximity to known or predicted protein interaction interfaces:
